        <h1>Music</h1>
        <img src="./music.jpg" alt="Music Sheet" class="pictures">
        <p>I love to listen to music. Music is one of my passions. Some of my favotite genres are indie, rock, alt, and pop. I will listen to anything that has a good beat though. If you have any music recs please do not hesitate to send them my way!</p>
        <p>Not only do I enjoy listening to music, I am also in love with playing instruments. I'll let you in on the inside scoop; I can play a plethera of instruments. My go-to instrument is the acoustic guitar. Aside from guitar, I also play piano, drums, and electric bass. My instrument chops do not stop there. They also include a variety of percussion instruments like: marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, steel pans, cymbals, boomwackers, chimes, gongs...essentially, I can pretty much play whatever falls under the catergory of percussive instrument. </p>

        <p>I often spend time outside. Whether that be walking alongside the Lakefront Trail in Chicago or through the large forest preserves in the Western Illinois suburbs. I love taking hiking trips and traveling.</p>
        <p>I enjoy taking photos of whatever nature presents before me. My favorite nature scene to capture is the sky.</p>

        <p>What keeps me running and going!</p>
        <p>I dedicate most of my morning to the craft that is coffee. I enjoy trying different blends of coffee and finding different notes in each one. This allows me to further develop my palette.</p>
        <p>Coffee inspires me to continue being curious and to keep broadening my horizons.</p>
